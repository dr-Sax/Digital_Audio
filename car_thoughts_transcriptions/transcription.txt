so this is this is your this is your nightly brought to you by the United results brought to you by your nightly thoughts brought to you is there a challenging question it's a challenging thing to choose not to read books and learn things from books 
start with a question and then a question on your own you're actually figuring things out I am headed in because of Chinese things in touch and trying to like make a Step Beyond just what makes music what qualities are present in music and why that question is being asked is because the main question is is there is such thing as a visual music 
what qualities would it need to have that's that's really like million dollar question is like how could I make official music and then maybe it's good to take some time to find what is impatient music right off the bat it's a I don't know yet turn off for sure but I can say is that it should do something similar to sound maybe not exactly a relationship to sound but something similar to it and so are going with the idea that when I was thinking through it earlier on the idea is that there is 
sound is composed of what is anything that comes from the air where is the media which transports your the air is the medium which transports sound waves and that's what I understood by a sizzix I mean it you back. But I say like the core unit of sound Ed Sherling a note 
different notes from the basic unit of just like a frequency of sound and there may be something like how about or stop today something like saxophone it is not displaying a single stitch when you're like sitting in. Play saxophone is like a spectrum those frequencies unfortunately and the development of Technologies probably I mean I would have to look into it 
I assume that Jackson State in battle battle this is a transitional period away from wouldn't it so I wouldn't instruments you got the brass go into jazz is and not just brass instruments but saxophone and being like an instrument which is perfect for because of how fast he accident siblings call Aaron piano your staple instrument but there's a hacker 
and that's the technology of this time music do they sell for length music does not change the Jazz guys pushed it as far as they could realistically it just became electronic because the fact is so sad unfortunately 
even digital sound there's no time to be an artist musician ideally play Debussy music. But just as far as like what is the music which is Avant Garde Urdu or pushing the envelope it happens to be like reset 10 years ago 
dubstep rap music basically All Electronics fish fillet it takes me a few dishes to make grape leaves even though I had some fine it seemed like station at Southwest Limited because I surely don't know how to use it its full capacity so 
can you sing any other digital audio workstation did try to be good for a baby that's okay some people like that controls what's this song what's the ideas audio wish I still had really made much progress 
is that it was an idea that actually just originates from my experiments with visual bro it's just like building a video frame by frame 60 frames per second in a magic I could go there. Which is audio music Maps navigator app there is copper with the digital audio like 
I find it fine if I could figure out how to do you spell the song for Philips sound based on based on some sort of mathematical evolution outside dislike I got to explain like with visual you're able to apply some sort of Matt based play fkj what you see on the screen 
the spirograph happened to be one of those examples for me algorithm variables just a second incident amount of different visual sex with her from it that was a powerful thing to me when she told me that like Mossberg at like 9 Mass allows the creator of musically 
the software was designed for the user it was designed to Not Crash program newest size it just gave me an open box of Master playlist. 
I feel very solidly then the guys who were inventing instruments and the guys who are inventing music whether they understood consciously or not they were in acting set timer that that's not a certainty but that's that's what I believe at this point just said set estate it's hard to categorize fast in one day 
SoundCloud application let's try to take it away from there because sending that's very clear and just obviously going to take her to mass also just because of the system here working on the computer is a mathematical engine to the car she got to talk to it make me some cool Circle do you to tell the computer more about voice 
Saturday 9 at the point where you can just think of some crazy abstract geometry and then something else knows it's not like I add and maybe I won't get to there right now we have the language of math to communicate with is Ian a visual graphics idea lab me to take back about some of the people who are challenging and then apparently kursa 
are the frontier Mass physics geyser best headlight play isolationists like facial aesthetic Alice Alice and I really don't have a keep ourselves Boxed In by those guys I can understand if that's the old was not really tapped into rationalism to site I kind of like that he thinks that color is 
an emotional about Chris just asked for a few generations of these types of thinkers and you get like Maxwell and then you guys decide brightest Play Maxwell am I responsible for the whole world like Maxwell's slicks exactly 
these guys seem to develop a series of fights how does light travel in this universe they're using math to understand it and actually you said you guys like Addison chicks eggs from the earth so we dug up different elements and compounds in town close it and then and then leave. 
as of 2020 got my everywhere. Rest of the adventures Mattox our material world to me play where you can drive on the highway and have constant bombardment of lamb supposed suicide everywhere 
so where does that bring us to 45 minutes left in the car again direct me to computer graphics do the same question what elements are part of a visual art I'll tell you the quality that is needed right now do it is for it to be playable it wasn't until the invention of the saxophone for us to be able to play with her are in a way that we could make songs 
text Auntie Shirley. Sound something that can't be changed I'm not in a bad way has had almost a full you can never say exactly full cuz I'm sure there's things that we really she was thinking or feeling he got as close as many people could ever have gotten to expression on an instrument and instantaneous expression on instrument 
I would come to say that the quality official music is that it must offer the player and a Billet the ability still Express themselves in real time and if they so choose to get to spend hours telling their craft they could they could express themselves in the moment in a way that other experiences are tools could not so where are we now play just reread it reiterates 
and the only way for me to play with it and is keep calling they have tails yes it's you can't there's no way around that bush if you want to be a good fish oil artist she does real time live stuff my skills and fortunately enough Easter visual music Inside Out it is something that has memories 
it's up to you it's up to the saxophone player to Remember The Melody of the song men like kind of cigarettes music to remember things Academy want to have this quality of visual music where there is there may be like a limited set of keys for things you could do but the combinations of how you use them tire sales this was good news for today this is a great trade store
