hello I'm going to be driving 
going to be driving to practice Florida deer head chopped off okay so just getting settled into driving this morning I had gone to 
to be honest I've been up for four and a half hours it's 9:30 in the morning I don't I don't mind temporarily in tries to get a early jump on the day so that's you know that's something I I like to do for a long time but was forced out of it because sort of like I have become I had the I have because I have that part of myself that likes the night and it's fun to stay up late at night and 
the other night goers and because of that then you try to sleep in more but I've been turning into someone you like I'm doing a lot in my day-to-day life demonstrate up recommending you to sleep 8 hours today I may not see you in a good recommendation at a certain point it's up to the individual to balance all the things in his life and learning how to sleep well and rested and still have the mental capacity to continue on to be honest 
especially like not getting full night's rest and then trying to focus on all the facts on all the factors I got it once this vehicle maybe I should get some more sleep but you know text waiting on you so I try to do a lot of things at once if I have to sacrifice some sleep get to where I'd like to be then I can rest later hopefully this conversation as always has free flowing that's the rules of the game I think as I get as I do more of these and get better at it sort of a way to actually connect my thoughts to my voice 
some patterns to defeat about for me like getting my sauce to connect with my voice and I don't often times get to be around people that I get to have my thoughts conveyed to but I think that a scale for me that I like just a basic skill for me is being able to communicate my ideas if I can do that I can be successful in this in this world and that doesn't mean good I mean bad that your hernia is trying to use the saxophone to communicate my ideas Graphics in Visual Studio 
acid bottom line it's trying to communicate yourself with the world I think I spent a lot of time developing other means to communicate with the world's and just with my voice just yet one of the eight flights of these dialogues is cute get myself a space to talk and think at the same time and have to vocalize my words I like the feedback mechanism like I'm using feedback a lot more just as a tool because if evolution is driven by feedback back of and ask her to work sound like her a larger time scale because humans are alive for hundreds of years so they have 
samples of information to observe brain or becoming a visual speed square Play We Are to be observing sayings vision from my personal experience Vision happens to be one of these that's really driving especially with the invention of artificial visual slices on your phone the things that you're seeing are driven by algorithms in that is something which interpret visual image 
I'm driving the car in like human-centric point of you when we when I'm able to compare myself to the things around me there is a Highway signpost with Highway cities in exit 7. I need to drive to talk because I'm also 
bars around me has appointed case of driving and reacting our feedback mechanisms that we have are my news in a car like we can ensure we can enjoy our toes lightly forward weekend make micro adjustments on the steering wheel base. Do you like a car in front of me just we had a traffic jam and this case seeing the image of the car breaking in front of me and it caused me to want to break my foot time and in this case like I honestly felt a little 
you feel some emotions based on the visual stimulus to No Doubt visual stimulus in the brain is connected to emotions they all have to work together in terms of the human body emotions are further down in the chain for for sure if you are example of brain structure in this is kind of what whatever his name to Rice Creole a Sherpa 
anyway that back I am reading this book I am a strange Loop and if you connect the theories to the brain the brain is the same that is like and my case like the brain it is the thing that it's doing the processing and it has programmability per se cuz we we have some influence over the pathways that we take in our brain when we make decisions especially just like depends on your brain and how you think but we have a little bit of control and we can learn we have 
it's hard to say that I have a full understanding of the formation of the brain like how does how to say if they have a gross of the brain understood if they've made skin childhood grains and as you get older you see what brains look like when you're in a 80 year old person versus a six-year-old boy they definitely have those scans I'm guessing sorry I had to make a turnover I'm focusing a lot more right now on my mental image like me thinking and talking out loud that I am trying to focus too small amount of attention on 
so anyway when it came to I I guess I want to continue on with that topic but is a free-flowing conversational ideas going back for it so I kind of just I have to use my train of thought to my advantage and see if it can laugh at me and understanding just like jazz directions at once and then you might reach the understand so then I was thinking on to in terms of jazz music when I was listening to Jazz it was something that for me and I focused solely on the sound on the players because of how I was exposed to music it was coming from I mean same with same with people who are we're buying records 
they were only supposed to sound because the electronic equipment would be no heart like development of Hardware it's not an easy thing to do and it takes time and it took time for okay thanks I'm last performance where at one point in time the only way to get access to musically by signing a person who plays mr. men and seeing them live and that's by Jory boy Jazz was until record became more popular than people identifying Jazz records you never heard of progression of the hardware the only way you can interface with that artist is through South that's something for me that like in my brain when I was spending 
listen to jazz music and visualizing music and trying to understand it then I mean and it brought my if you some of these jazz people they they they took Kylie to being able to communicate just through wife eating one medium sound and with advancements in the computer are having the control of fish video any one person tent communicate to another person what they see with their eyes and hopefully real time that's what I'm trying to do. 
very general this is I mean I haven't placed it into words yet but I can try here to see you sis I'm trying to answer it is there a visual music that was that's my question my question is is there a good visual music and my I want to put this in place of the contest I learned from school I learned about finding a previous success next generation service Corps look for existing models 
but I know for a fact is that there wasn't music well maybe I don't know that for a fact but what I'm saying is that Society has evolved their dice Ventana play music doesn't have to be black and white thing because problematically Enlightenment thinkers has made us focused as a society on classifying things in labor 
it's always up to the individual how how they use their intelligence to understand the world like on 290 and love music like many other Concepts does not need to follow a strict rules as to what it is but I think the culture knows at music to be nowadays it's a changing ideas and more and more so over time call chair has begun to recognize music connected to video and that's a interesting thing because initially music 
like I said it in person by a human body in individual and then once we created Electronics it actually created a split between sound and vision temporarily and we are very close to rejoining that ability from I knew in a new way and it is accessible reach more people in your music if you're communicating your music through the and through the internet and it's a way to interact I think mixed Luann is right and our society is changing 
electronically driven we're still moving around the globe I have a 30 miles to get Subway but anyway we are on the Move we're finding ways to live at live out her. Forget it. Places with the world in SouthPark travel if we get there that is a way to connect unfortunately unfortunately but some of the best musicians they have been to be 
like when it when it comes to when I think of the Jazz Giants and such guys happen to be like with their instruments the saxophone was an instrument that came about about like 117 average call Chang coming from like yeah he doesn't have much but he has a love for his family and community members are out is now able to you uses technology I got to make a 
he has a technology in front of them at 2 master and well that Mastery didn't involve Vision at all it was purely sad sad sad and vilest there's very few videos of coach and playing and I just imagine I can only imagine what he looks like when he's playing I imagine he's got his body fully engaged into it I imagine Coltrane was the type of player who whose mind went somewhere else like when he's playing his mind is just on a different plane of existence 
yes like totally different dimension sometimes when I try to think through my ideas and he is able to get himself on a TV is getting it signed into a new place and he can only do so through sound well we are able to now being an artist in the Modern Age you has the ability to control what someone sees if you want to be a good if you want to be or if you're saw you should do both and not focus on one because not that 
not that there's anything wrong with just focusing on butt I mean someone like Coltrane I don't know if you're going to go any farther than he did with sound how to make cookies I don't know if you're going to go any farther than clothes change it was sad like to think you could achieve that it took like a giant like he took the leap into the check the saxophone and stuff to sound and exploring sound very far and you've got painters graffiti are you've got some of my Basquiat visual art instantaneous racial R2 
and felt like getting the graffiti s wrabel paint getting that technology taking that very far too and Coltrane is a multi-instrumentalist are there any schools that allow them to find different sounds in the world and how it goes. She was like that to you with all my heart and piano finally got their ways to explore army base in that way different and so I just personally like living in the situation being an artist trying to understand what's been done before you realize that you have to do both now and you should do both like especially if you're driven towards that so that's something I've driven towards is finding a way to express the visual medium medium 
add doing those together as like I'm use for most Harmony like having the sound off of my ear your ideas and so you know you've got movies down at the development and technology and movies do both music and words like that dialogue and visual that cost so many hours is how many people like from my thinking like very Grand project projects are worthwhile getting a lot of people together and working together on an idea that cost a lot of money got to put a lot of money together for that's that's well and good but we need 
we need an inexpensive ways for each other. We have to work list now and that's why I heard I was listening to the podcast this week for tomorrow Facebook on at the end of the podcast from the late 60s and was one of the pioneers of computer graphics and so you see it you see the movie slowly evolving from being people 
turn the camera and now you're getting more of a computer-generated movie and so anyway I've just like when you look at the Evolution of Music as a model you see that the way that music in fact evolve in a similar way that vision Vision may become something which it's increasingly Streamlight original Source blood play original sources of hearing things what have to be in Rio and the real world and you have to been around something that made it sound like I object or person 
disconnect with physical objects because of the transfer information through electricity is you mad it's it's just a gigantic sounds that are created by the CPUs and you're getting electronic music list it's like listening to they did occur physically as some other position on the earth at some other time and through a process that wasn't always just are you know you got a lot alright so I'm just trying to point out that the music ain't heard 
change it from its original form it had been redefined and that's why that's why I was trying to say earlier that music cannot be thought of as a black and white face change it to a different one it is he said word in the dictionary so where's that leave us now he said with the question bringing it back to vision what is Vision evolving to do. Is that to physically be in a place 
observe anything you had to be you had to go fly over the to the Grand Canyon and look at that mother fucker in the face like to say before the camera with his invention of the transformative event for recently spread across the map but I I I I I understand that vision is incurring an evolution Just Like Music that sounded sounded its maybe it's younger brother something like older brother in my heart so 
play something new is going to spawn a decision that I'm not sure what it is yet and it's cold so Road I'm not sure how this vision is going to evolve but it's currently shifting and I think it's going to become glass about people who are creators of do you want to watch it's becoming less about anything physically about I'm seeing them a artificially generated surface like TV it's been away from you been wanting to see people on the screen like not wanting to see why performers this year I think we're going to want to be seeing things that aren't people 
and we are seeing strange characters acting out their own personalities and that's maybe why don't you know that's why I said there's reality TV show The contribution to voice and I'm just frankly a bit I want to go a bit beyond that I want to communicate to people things that don't have concept says people playset maybe at Willie both Concepts from nature I want to show people things better I think that Vision should Electronic media should serve 
is that music is currently serving to us while we are while we are listening to music it's advancing our day-to-day life like I can drive around and listen to music in the car and I can focus on what I need to do and get then I can still enjoy music and I think movies and TV shows stay dry ice in a little bit too much and maybe that's a good thing like focusing on 72 hours of your life if you can I don't know it's like you take a lot of an our Generation show and there's a tower a chosen the season 
have you taken any hours of your life universe and we're watching a lot of TV and we're getting sucked into the TV we're experiencing class of the world and that's I think that's a problem I don't know if that's a problem but I'd say that's something but I don't want to label things as problems but it's something that I'd like to have it it have an effect on us through my art I think that vision we should be able to experience art in a way that's not distracting to our lights it's not eating a way out you don't have to sit in front of a TV for hours 
I want people to experience life in a fun way if you're driving around in a car. Some excitement going on like through the windshield you've got your your viewing the outside of the world then say maybe like on top of signs you got little glowing zigzags. Just like making it a little bit more fun I don't know if that's a good thing for society but I think it causes us to look around more I think it'll cause us to look around more at the world and less that and it what's in a box and what's on internet platforms like I want to get I want to connect with the world then it's going to take 
to get there it's going to take a lot of work you have to start somewhere so where I think I'm going to start with this feedback loops using anyway I'm trying to get I'm trying to get the GoPro camera to connect to a live stream over internet NFL an important step and I shouldn't ask the late chief are all the time so I can focus on trying to get something working that you can play around with that lesson for it so you know that's something I should focus on in the future I'm looking 
when you're letting off everywhere all at once driven to move forward before you mastered what you've just you've reached the past I'm so you can keep moving and you didn't actually get to dive as deep into the player that you are working with that one time so I can always come back to it I'd like to place my visuals I got the GoPro I'm having a bit of trouble to I mean I've been having some problems to connect with it over Wi-Fi those are the two Communications protocols that I have at my disposal to connect
