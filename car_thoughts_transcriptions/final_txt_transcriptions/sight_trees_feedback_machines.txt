there is much to be said start seeing things without wearing glasses sitting alone in the Darkness and a nearby park there's a Japanese stone garden dedicated to man who died from this time he got in his mid-twenties and although I don't know you know I only know so much person 
reading his inscription I guess Rock had a little bit about him he likes Japanese culture LOL man this place to me has always been a meditative Spa. He said a top set of alderney rocks and beneath me I stay I said find cross-legged two rectangular wooden to describe them it's almost like he took 
two-by-fours and arrange them standing upright with the smallest side lengths facing up long ways skinny ways and you stack them with a little bit of gap between and then there's there's two of these two rectangular structures and they're short of share and they're just overlapping right near the maybe say last third of the size of the seats and the arrangement has that the arrangement of the blocks and I said the arrangement of the structures and the scenery is intra 
makes you feel like you're in nature but you also have silence wooden and you also have a plaque so I like to come here come here and thanks has a nice geometry to it and that's what I'm all about but what I wanted to say about seeing is that well if you think of the history of man we didn't have any glasses we didn't have these kind of lenses these Optical enhancements that helped us understand our world and Optical enhancement for always 
advancements so we have to take the argument that things that enhance your vision I good for you that's the the typical conclusion or like that's the that's the dominant narrative you would say is opticals like things like glasses they enhance your vision and the idea of what is glasses it's going to change and problematically most people in the culture they see a technology as very binary 
so glasses straightforwardly are seen as a technology that serve one purpose pretty much and there is a simple test around seeing like the ability to see is defined by a test addition test and it's a very rationally based you have say about 10 ft 9 and 10 ft a little bit last probably like eight feet between you and a kind of white poster board that has varying size of letters that are in a classic font and this is one of 
test for seeing at the doctor's office when you go to the eye doctor and I guess for my own experience the conclusion was almost certainly that you need glasses like I'm in school and then I'm having trouble seeing the board the words on the board from a projected surface and I and my school they used Carlos Elmo projectors which was like a form of a light that gets projected down I'd say those those early kind of projectors it has some very strong Optical 
that was able to mirror a transparent the teacher to stay with use like a transparent kind of slide they would call it and these kind of slides you could put a top paper you could take that I'm sorry. Are in the early days we had like just a ditions and adding numbers together to get one plus one equals two and anyway maybe it's a little more complicated than that we're staying doing algebra and stuff so they put the piece of paper down on this it's pretty big structure it had like a bold or a big bulb glass bulb for light and 
you pee and it had a kind of a transparent covering over that and then he put the paper on top of it and then you put a a slide on top of that and then you are able to kind of ice I don't know how exactly it work but the light was able to reflect I don't know if it's reflecting sir it would be interesting to kind of look into the technology how did it work for those Elmo's Elmo projector whatever I forget what it's called something like that that gradually that technology changed to be like cameras and more computer-based stuff and anyway along that transition we have this we have the feedback loop of vision which is important 
I see perception Through The Eyes that sense of sight hippie it should not be thought of as a binary thing we think of Asians matcha tea simply we should think of vision more along the lines of sorry I want to go in 
explain more about Visions like why would I think about the current my experience with visions so when you are seeing things and when I was in school most certainly that the teacher would have you sitting around the room and looking at some artificial screen eunos printed paper for one thing printed books you have you have the whole world of print but then gradually it became much more digital and you've got you've got screens that are really close to you but throughout one's life they're being exposed to the sense of sight always you know if you have eyes and you're not blind you're exposed to the sense of sight 
and really it's more so about nurture in this case not genetically I think we have with our Linus understanding and like this is all based on learning like how you learn how you're educated and so I just say like some of the more interesting things about site are often overlooked and we and we think of sight just as a I guess I you don't have to you have to take responsibility for it but I've understood site or been forced to buy living in the culture I live in town to think of sight as like hi binary thing likes 
is just a kind of camera for you that helps you say like with driving your I since we have we've created a structure around us like a in architecture an electronic architecture we think now like with we create a world around us that is both natural and both digital and we have a lot of people don't know on Earth we have a lot of people that are interacting with this ecosystem and extent of someone's life involves their relationship in the world around them which both includes things that 
occur around us naturally and by naturally I mean there are things that if humans didn't exist would be here in a matter what and then there's things that have disappeared because he was has existed but anyway at this point in time we live in a world that involves the Q not just too but like you know involves that Dynamic has the technology we create and the world we live in that has come kind of sucks what we deem to be natural eye for based on the composition of the earth and its temperature and its weather conditions and you know the environment of where we live the things that would grow here 
depending on us are seemingly caring about them but we're one in the same we come from the Earth to wear something that the Earth has the environment of the Earth has created humans hey so we are running faster across the world and doing many things were part of the ecosystem so I think just first and we have to accept that it's not a binary there there's just two a dynamic it's not it's not that there's nature and there's technology nature itself is like a technology like trees are things that seemingly evolved and expanded across the Earth because they were able to harvest the energy from the 
well that was their solution to life they grew tall probably in the days of trees like there's a lot of competition for sunlight therapy meretriz who a tall tale than other trees and grew wide and stretch their leaves out for energy and so yeah that Earth had a competition for visual not a visual but like a stimulus of energy I don't give a energy from the Sun drove energy from the Sun was one of the few nights one as a man 
factors that drove growth of trees and I'm sure there's a lot of people who have studied the evolution of trees now I'd be a cool topic to go and try out for sure read some books on that be at were part of that dynamic just like trees we look at our life's much different because eventually we all right we have we have a lot of different differences than trees like trees they are they stand still and the experience energy differently than us we experience energy in life you know we experienced energy and so many ways 
and say it happens to be an energy of humans that is like that's what you have I'd say like we don't know much as much about like I don't know as much about Evolution as I could and its seemingly like a really big topic and it's important to also acknowledged that we that the lip being alive and being aware of your own Evolution being aware of evolution in the first place is crazy but she's you know they had some way of who knows what their intelligence is I know it's hard to believe that so it's hard to understand things that are so different from you 
and that's what it is a little bit about being in nature and trying to talking to trees and you know talk to them tell them about you that's the only way they can get to know you is if you go and talk to them so this is a problem because you know when you start understanding the world I when you've been understanding the world there's just like where to start you got to find some basis for understanding and really there's there's so much you can learn about in the world but I'd say something that's going on now 
is that humans are learning just as much from learning more about the world through its man-made structures and learning less about the world through the structures that evolved before us and you know that's not a it's not to say it's a problem I mean I haven't given reasons why it's a problem cuz it's just Evolution it's just how people are going but it's a big shift it's certainly a big shift learning less about the world that came before us then the ones that we've architected ourselves so we're kind of living in a world of our own invention which is 
like Willy Wonka you know anyway so that's what that's kind of interesting I would say that I'm talking a lot about these deep kind of Concepts here but I don't want to detract too much from site and I just brought up trees as a good example cuz that's what I'm around and that's what I have to contemplate on but we we are endowed with different senses we're at a human we just have we can understand ourselves and we can understand the various sorts of senses that are going on and for me having an 
about having a conflicting balance have the census anyway each person on Earth they interact with their senses differently and that includes the feeling spectrum that includes the I'd say I would say like there's things like thinking and feeling and anyway what is labeled as feeling is like left to us to say like that's something I don't understand well I think we just label things as feeling like I do myself when it's like oh I don't understand it like that happened to me like but if you have 
Tay k if you take a sense and it's a sense that's very strong for you mean and you understand it more than the others with humans like we have a choice through our bodies I'm we're growing up based on the environment around us we have we have a dynamic not a choice for say but when we're growing up and we're using our senses regularly moving around the world seeing things touching things talking to people feeling emotions running all these different things that humans can do there is going on a grater 
from the sense of sight then the sense of sight in the sense of sound and there has been for kind of the sensor feeling sense of touch and sense of emotion and connection at least if it has felt that way from me and its present in the series to like that I studied in school it's very evident that the thinkers were very much focused on theories of energy edit applications have been very dominant Lee sound and sight and 
humans have created the ability to change what they see we see the tree we used to see the natural landscapes 100% of the time and now we see human-created Landscapes hundred percent of the time almost you know it depends on the day depends on how high up your screen time is what's your your weekly use sunscreen time your average daily hours 7 hours today on screen you know we're seeing it's it's obvious we have to admit it we're seeing we're seeing more and more that's coming from the phone screen or the TV and 
yes we're seeing of the natural world and I've met people who have taken conflict to this and you can tell they struggled with it and they were big tree huggers and and that's something that is probably part of people's explanation so we have to admit that that is true it's a fact of existence at least from Nina facts of existence are they such perception so if you have to take my word for it that's how I experienced my understanding so far and what I want to say is that site site is something that is a technology it's a technic glasses are attached 
Najee when you wear glasses you are young and you get glasses you've understood the relationship with glasses as being I went to the doctor I read some letters on a triangular pyramid and I've gotten to a certain row of being able to read the letters and then tossed that point it's a little fuzzy for me to read and because of my ranking on this test now I need to wear glasses I need to have Optical enhancements that now allow me to read lines that are smaller and fine from us further from the same dense distance away so what I'm trying to say with this test is that 
it causes the can from LAX from my understanding and can cause the larger bodies of people to think that site is a matter of distance away you know like a numerical thing like are you are we've I guess when we start to understand site and we're growing up we start to think of our eyes as tools tools that allows to read things like read words on a page with when our young were like understanding the world and we're understanding all the tasks and things that are expected of expected of us and we're just trying to do a good job and make our parents happy and like learning about school learning in school is something that you're supposed to do and make your family proud of you that you achieved something there's those factors but 
have people learning from Vision in school a lot a lot of what you are taught is through the sense of sight and I think we think of that technology has the glasses
